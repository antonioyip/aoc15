# Overview
I decided to explore the [Go Language](https://golang.org/) by solving problems from [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). This repository contains my solutions for [AoC 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015).

## Getting started
- Checkout this repo to $GOPATH/src
- go install aoc15/graph
- go install aoc15/permutations

## Running a solution
- cd dayX
- go run dayX.go
